In order to build the code make sure that you have run "npm install" to install the most recent library changes. It is a good idea to do this every time you pull code from the repsoitory. The code you pull may use libraries that you did nto have installed. Therefore make sure you run "npm install" before trying to build the code. 

To buid and run the code type "npm start" from within the project directory inside vs code.
